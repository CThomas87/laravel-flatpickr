Using this package you can add a beautiful date or datetime picker into your project without touching any javascript with the power or laravel component.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require asdh/laravel-flatpickr
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="flatpickr-config"
```

You can publish the assets with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="flatpickr-assets"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'css_url' => env('FLATPICKR_CSS_URL', null),
    'js_url' => env('FLATPICKR_JS_URL', null),
    'use_style' => env('FLATPICKR_USE_STYLE', true),
];
```

## Usage

You need to include the css and js that ships with the package in your html or blade file.

### Adding Css

Include this style at the head section of your page:

```php
@include('flatpickr::components.style')
```

Or you can use laravel blade component syntax:

```html
<x-flatpickr::style />
```

If you want to use different `url` for the css then you can change it from the .env file:

```env
FLATPICKR_CSS_URL=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flatpickr/4.6.9/flatpickr.min.css
```

You can even change the `url` from the component itself:

```php
<x-flatpickr::style url="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flatpickr/4.6.9/flatpickr.min.css" />
```

The `url` passed form the component will take more priority over the config file.

### Adding Js

Similarly include this script at the bottom of your page:

```php
@include('flatpickr::components.script')
```

Or you can use laravel blade component syntax:

```html
<x-flatpickr::script />
```

If you want to use different `url` for the js then you can change it from the .env file:

```env
FLATPICKR_JS_URL=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flatpickr/4.6.9/flatpickr.min.js
```

You can even change the `url` from the component itself:

```php
<x-flatpickr::script url="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flatpickr/4.6.9/flatpickr.min.js" />
```

The `url` passed form the component will take more priority over the config file.

### Using the component

Add it to your page.

```html
<x-flatpickr />
```

Yes, it's that simple. Now you have a beautiful looking date picker in your page without touching a single javascript at all.

## Component props

### id
Type: string

Set the id of the component. It will apply id to the underlying `input` tag. If no id is provided, it will use the autogenerated id.

```html
<x-flatpickr id="laravel-flatpickr" />
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
